    <h2>My unqualified predictions about the future of computing (3/20/25)</h2>
    <p>
        I believe that analogue computers will make a comeback. Will
        it be clockless CPUs, op amp computers, or maybe even
        quantum (if you can call them analogue) computers? It could
        be any of these, but currently I am betting on photonic
        processors. Because, why stop at the speed of silicon, when
        you can reach the speed of light?
