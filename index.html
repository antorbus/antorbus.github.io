                    My unqualified predictions about the future of computing
                    (3/20/25)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I believe that analogue computers will make a comeback. Will
                    it be clockless CPUs, op amp computers, or maybe even
                    quantum (if you can call them analogue) computers? It could
                    be any of these, but currently I am betting on photonic
                    processors. Because, why stop at the speed of silicon, when
                    you can reach the speed of light?

                <h3>Some RISC-Y thoughts (1/12/25)</h3>
                <p>
                    The other day I was looking at what RISC V processors were
                    available in the market (as one does) and I stumbled upon
                    the Milk-V Duo. It costs $5. Granted, it is not a HPC chip,
                    but the cheapness of it got me thinking: embedded devices
                    aside, RISC V allows companies to produce processors without
                    having to pay massive licensing fees to companies like
                    Intel. And not only companies, individuals too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe, in the future, there will be open source HDL
                    implementations of RISC V cores that allow start-ups and
                    hobbists alike to program FPGAs or tape out custom chips
                    from companies like Atomic Semi (looking at you Sam Zeloof
                    and Jim Keller). Perhaps specilized and modular hardware
                    could be used to power cool edge applications, new AI chips,
                    and maybe even a free and decentralized internet through
                    transparent and trustworthy hardware.
